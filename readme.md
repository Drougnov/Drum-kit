## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Hello! Thanks for cheking out this repository.

## What is it about

It's a drum kit sound generator made with vanilla JS. I've been practicing basic javascript project from [wesbos's javascript 30 course](https://courses.wesbos.com/account/access/62adf09d8ed3995269d75c5a).

This project teaches(especially) you how to:

-play around with data-* attribute

-call function when transition ends

Here is my project site's url-
